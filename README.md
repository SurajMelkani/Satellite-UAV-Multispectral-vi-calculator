# Satellite & UAV Multispectral Vegetation Index Calculator

An interactive, web-based tool built with **Python** and **Streamlit** to rapidly process and visualize multispectral imagery and RGB photos from satellite and drone platforms.

**[Launch Live Satellite & UAV Multispectral Vegetation Index Calculator]()**(https://satellite-uav-multispectral-vi-calculator.streamlit.app/]
## Overview

This application allows users to upload different, individual band GeoTIFFs (such as Red, Green, NIR, Red Edge, and Blue) or a standard RGB photo to dynamically compute up to 11 distinct vegetation indices. It processes the imagery at a preview resolution for rapid rendering and requires no Coordinate Reference System (CRS) transformations, making it highly efficient for quick field assessments.

📁 **Demo Data Included**
To test the platform, a complete set of sample multispectral bands and an RGB photo are available in the `sample_data/` folder of this repository. Simply download them and upload them into the live platform.

### Supported Indices:
* **NDVI, GNDVI, NDRE, SAVI** (Standard & Soil-Adjusted)
* **EVI, EVI2** (Enhanced Vegetation Indices for high biomass)
* **NGRDI, RENDVI, NIRRENDVI** (Red-Edge and Visible contrast)
* **RGBVI, VARI** (RGB-only indices)
